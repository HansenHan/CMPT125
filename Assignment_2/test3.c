Firstly, the algorithm create a new array called A_new[R+1] by using max number "h" and min number "w" in the array A[N]; those steps running time is O(N). Secondly, the algorithm translate A[N] into A_new[R+1] for each element e in A[N]; because there are N elements, so the running time is O(N). Finally, the algorithm translate A_new[R+1] into the A[N] as the sorted array; this time the running time is O(R), because there are R+1 elements in the A_new[R+1]. Because those three steps are paratactic; therefore, the total running time is O(N)+O(R)=O(N).

This algorithm will create a new array A_new[R+1], and this array's size is depended on the range of elements in array A[]. If the range of array A[N] is very big, the size of A_new[R+1] is very big. Such as, the array is A[2]={1,10^10}; the size of A_new[R+1] will be 10^10 and is will run 10^10 times in the last step. In this case, the running time is much larger than other sort algorithm and it will also waste many memory. Thus, this algorithm has a very great limitation. So we never discuss it.
