Question 1:
a)
(1) The algorithm time is O(n). In the function, it has an initial value "n" and give a value "tmp" which is n+1. After that, in the for loop, it makes the s equals to tmp+i which i's initial value is 1 and it is bigger 1 every the loop until i=n. So, the s=n+1+(sum(1+...+n)) and there are n+1 times additive operation. Therefore, the O-natation is O(n).
(2) This function is to calculate n+1 plus a series of number which from 1 to n. It can be improved and the improved algorithm is:
int func(int n)
{
  int s = 0;
  s = (n+1)^2/2
  return s;
}

b)
